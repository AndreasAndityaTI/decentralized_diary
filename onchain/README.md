# On-chain Contracts (Aiken)

This folder contains Aiken smart contracts for the Decentralized Diary application on Cardano. The contracts implement a comprehensive journaling platform with NFT rewards, subscriptions, privacy controls, and a research data marketplace.

## Smart Contracts Overview

### Validators
- **subscription.ak** - AI Companion subscription management with tiered access (Free/Basic/Premium)
- **journal_access.ak** - Privacy controls for journal entries (Public/Private/Paid access)
- **profit_sharing.ak** - Automated profit distribution for NFT sales between creators and platform
- **data_marketplace.ak** - Research data marketplace with access controls and payments

### Policies
- **first_journal.ak** - One-time NFT minting for users' first journal entry
- **streak.ak** - NFT rewards for journaling streaks (Weekly/Monthly/Custom periods)
- **data_marketplace.ak** - NFTs representing data ownership in the research marketplace

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¨ NFT Rewards System
- **First Journal NFT**: Automatic minting for new users' first entry
- **Streak NFTs**: Rewards for consistent journaling (7-day, 30-day, custom periods)
- **Unique Validation**: On-chain enforcement prevents duplicate rewards

### ðŸ”’ Privacy & Access Control
- **Flexible Privacy**: Public, private, or paid access to journal entries
- **Owner Control**: Journal creators maintain full control over their data
- **Research Access**: Special provisions for verified academic researchers

### ðŸ’° Monetization & Profit Sharing
- **Data Marketplace**: "Kaggle-like" platform for journal datasets
- **Automated Royalties**: Smart contract ensures fair profit distribution
- **Research Value**: Target market includes psychology students and researchers

### ðŸ¤– AI Companion Subscriptions
- **Tiered Access**: Free, Basic, and Premium subscription levels
- **Usage Limits**: Daily/monthly interaction limits based on tier
- **Flexible Billing**: Support for various subscription models

## Architecture Principles

- **IPFS-First**: Only IPFS CIDs are stored on-chain; full content remains decentralized
- **Off-Chain Validation**: Complex business logic (streak verification, uniqueness) handled off-chain
- **Minimal On-Chain Data**: Maximum privacy and efficiency
- **Cardano Native**: Built specifically for Cardano's UTXO model

## Prerequisites

- Install Aiken: `curl -sSL https://get.aiken.rs | bash`
- Cardano testnet node access for integration (Ogmios/Blockfrost/Koios as needed)

## Project Structure

- `aiken.toml` â€” project config with contract metadata
- `validators/` â€” spending validators for complex logic
- `policies/` â€” minting policies for NFTs
- `build/` â€” compiled artifacts (generated)

## Build

```bash
cd onchain
aiken build
```

Artifacts will be in `onchain/build/`.
